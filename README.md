# $hare.io

Share.io is an app made for users to lend/borrow household belongings. This proves to be particularly useful when items that are needed on occasion, such as tents, snowboarding gear, irons and ironing boards. Users can easily sign up for an account to borrow or lend at their own convenience, charging a fee for each transaction. Lenders have the ability to determine whether the item is to be picked up or delivered, as well as for how long their item can be borrowed for.
